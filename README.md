Unified Cart Extension
A Smarter Way to Shop and Plan
The Unified Cart Extension is a browser tool that helps you gather items from any website into a single cart. Whether you're shopping across multiple stores or planning a trip, this extension keeps everything organized in one place and can generate a receipt or itinerary when you're ready.

Features
Universal Cart
Manually add items from any website by entering the name, price, and quantity.

Smart Scraping
On a product page, click a button and the extension will attempt to auto-fill the product name and price. Works on many sites, but not guaranteed on all due to differences in how websites are built.

AI-Powered Receipt or Itinerary Generation
Once your cart is filled, the extension uses Google Gemini to create a clear, itemized receipt. If your cart contains travel-related items (like hotels or flights), it will instead generate a basic travel itinerary.

Simulated Checkout
You can simulate a full checkout experience by clicking a button. This doesnâ€™t process payments, but demonstrates what a unified checkout could look like.

Installation Instructions

Make sure you have all the required files in a single folder:
manifest.json, popup.html, popup.js, background.js, content-script.js, popup.css, hello_extensions.png

Important Notes
Gemini API Key Required
You need a valid Gemini API key for AI receipt/itinerary generation. Add your key in background.js. Without it, this feature will not work.

Scraping Limitations
Since every website is different, scraping might not work perfectly on all product pages. Manual entry is always available as a fallback.

Reload After Changes
If you edit any extension files (like updating your API key), go to chrome://extensions/ and click the reload icon on the extension card. If issues continue, remove and re-add the extension.
